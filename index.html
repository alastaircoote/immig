            <h1>Who is your immigrant<em> and what do they do?</em></h1>
            <h2><span class='leader'>O</span>bama's decisive electoral victory and perceived Republican demographic weaknesses have given rise
                to a new push for immigration reform in 2013. While debate rages on illegal immigration, there is a broad consensus on the need to reform high-skilled immigation. But what do America's highly skilled immigrants do, and where do they settle? And what does it mean for the country?</h2>

                <h3>What is a highly skilled immigrant?</h3>
                <p>Every year, the US grants between 100,000 and 200,000 visas to so called "highly skilled immigrants", who will work in specialty occupations that require  a college education or above.
                <p>So, what do they do? Well, if you happen to meet a newly arrived highly skilled immigrant, the overwhelming chances are that they work in computing. In 2012, there were more visas granted in the 'Computer and Mathematical' category than 
                    every other category combined. Even within this category, 'Computer Occupations' accounts
                    for some fifty thousand visas.
