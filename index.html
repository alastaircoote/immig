            <h1>Who is your immigrant<em> and what do they do?</em></h1>
            <h2><span class='leader'>I</span>mmigration is A Big Deal. It's official. A divisive issue as little
                as a year ago, the 2012 election proved that both parties have a lot to gain by tackling the issue. As always, the devil is in the details- and there are a lot of details. One is the separate handling of highly skilled immigrants, but who are they? What do they do? Let's take a look at
                2012's visa application figures and get some answers.</h2>
            <div id="side">
                <h3>What do highly skilled immigrants do?</h3>
                <p>Employing a foreign worker is not a simple or fast process, so why do it? Well, there can be
                    many reasons (and we'll examine one negative one shortly) but the main reason- and reason
                    for the whole program being created- is to employ workers who simply don't exist in sufficient numbers within the US.</p>
                <p>Every year, the US grants between 100,000 and 200,000 visas to these workers. They all have one
                    thing in common- they have either a college education or "equivalent experience". That's the "highly skilled" part of the visa- and an overwhelming number of these highly skilled immigrants work in tech. To be more specific, computing- in 2012 there were
                    more "Computing and Mathematical" visas given out than every other category put together.
                <p>That's not to say there aren't exceptions- some eight thousand workers arrived in 2012 to work in
                    finance, while just over four thousand arrived to work in the health industry.</p>
